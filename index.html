          <h2>Why Dublin?</h2>
          <h3>Town of the hurdle ford</h3>
          <p>
            The Gaelic name for Dublin is ‘Baile Atha Cliath’ which translates
            literally as ‘town of the hurdle ford’, a description of the bank of
            wooden hurdles built up across the river Liffey by the Vikings. They
            founded Dublin at the beginning of the ninth century. Dublin has
            been the scene of wars and conflicts until it defined its own
            identity in the twentieth century. Today, Dublin is a modern and
            culturally rich city. With its busy city center and green
            surroundings it's an ideal destination for all types of travelers.

            <h4>St. Stephen's Green Park</h4>
            <p>
              St Stephen’s Green is one of Dublin’s most evocative parks and the
              most accessible, being located in the heart of the city and just
              an easy saunter from Trinity College. The park dates back to the
              17th century and its place in Irish history is celebrated with a
              large number of monuments and busts of important figures,
              including James Joyce and Arthur Guinness. Take a walk along the
              tree-shaded trails and among the flower beds of tulips, geraniums,
              wallflowers and petunias. Watch mallards, swans and moorhens glide
              across the ornamental lake and pay a visit to Edward Delaney’s
              moving Famine Memorial in the northwest corner.

              Hi! My name is Renée and I created this website as part of a
              project to develop my coding skills. Despite the rain, Dublin is
              one of the nicest cities I've ever been to because of its relaxed
              atmosphere and friendly people.
