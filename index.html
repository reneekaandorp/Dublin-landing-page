          <h2>Why Dublin?</h2>
          <h3>Town of the hurdle ford</h3>
          <p>
            The Gaelic name for Dublin is ‘Baile Atha Cliath’ which translates
            literally as ‘town of the hurdle ford’, a description of the bank of
            wooden hurdles built up across the river Liffey by the Vikings. They
            founded Dublin at the beginning of the ninth century. Dublin has
            been the scene of wars and conflicts until it defined its own
            identity in the twentieth century. Today, Dublin is a modern and
            culturally rich city. With its busy city center and green
            surroundings it's an ideal destination for all types of travelers.

              <h4>Dublin Castle</h4>
              <p>
                The history of this city-centre site stretches back to the
                Viking Age. The castle itself was built in the thirteenth
                century. The building served as a military fortress, a prison, a
                treasury and courts of law. Rebuilt as the castle we now know in
                the seventeenth, eighteenth, nineteenth and twentieth centuries,
                Dublin Castle is now a government complex and an arena of state
                ceremony. The state apartments, undercroft, chapel royal,
                heritage centre and restaurant are open to visitors.

            <p>
              Hi! My name is Renée and I created this website as part of a
              project to develop my coding skills. Despite the rain, Dublin is
              one of the nicest cities I've ever been to because of its relaxed
              atmosphere and friendly people.
